# birds_Decho
The aim of this repository is to obtain the total abundance of 72 bird species for 
the Dehcho and Edehzie area in the Northwest Territories for the short (2011-2031) and the 
long (2011-2091) terms. 
The workflow is the following:
1. Crop  and the original rasters to the study areas of interest.
2. Make rasters of the density changes and proportional changes.
3. Calculate the total abundance.
4. Convert density rasters to probability of occurrence
5. Make the maps of changes in the probability of occurrence.
